Steps to reproduce the results
Download the complete folder - covid_19_usa, Which should contain folders(code, data, docs)
Set that folder(covid_19_usa) as your working directory
Run the file (final-project.qmd) file, and it will automatically fetch the data from the data data folder and run.. 

To open my final rendered report, it is best to the HTML file in the docs folder which come with the files to see all the graphs and a very nice interactive table
I also added rendedred file in pdf, but for best visualization open the HTML file.


Thank you
