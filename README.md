Steps to reproduce the results
Download the complete folder - covid_19_usa, Which should contain folders(code, data, docs)
Set that folder(covid_19_usa) as your working directory
Run the (final-project.qmd) file, and it will automatically fetch the data from the data folder and run.

To open my final rendered report, it is best to use the HTML file in the docs folder which comes with the (final-project_files)
to see all the graphs and a very nice interactive table
I also added a rendered file in pdf, but for best visualization open the HTML file.


Thank you
